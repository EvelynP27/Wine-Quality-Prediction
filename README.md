# Wine-Quality-Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a machine-learning project focused on training a random forest algorithm to predict the quality of wine based on parameters.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of 1599 samples of different wines. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle: Red Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)

## Approach
- Importing data: Reading the data and transforming the labels
- Model training: Training the selected algorithm on the preprocessed dataset.
- Model evaluation: No assessment

## Results

Takes in customized wine parameters and outputs the prediction (good wine or bad wine)

## Usage
1. Download the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)

3. Open this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/103xEESfkA2BpFe3_39rZGTS8_px9HnP9?usp=sharing) to access the Google Colab file and make a copy

4. Run the Google Colab to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Programming languages: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
